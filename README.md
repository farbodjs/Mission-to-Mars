# Mission-to-Mars
## Introduction
In this project, our goal is to adjust the current web application to include all four of the hemisphere images in the following link:
- [Astrology](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)
We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter Librarries to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then we stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used a web application to display the data. Finally, we altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
